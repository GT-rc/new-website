Make docs for this!!!!! This is terrible, I don't even know which f-ing flask environment goes
with this project.

To Start Flask Env: source activate site-env

Packages: certifi, click, flask, flask-sqlalchemy (forge), itsdangerous, jinja2, markupsafe,
        pip, pymysql, python, setuptools, sqlalchemy (forge), vc, vs2105_runtime, werkzeug,
        wheel, wincertstore

To run project:
        - In main folder in terminal:
            - Activate flask env
            - Run: python main.py
            - Open http://localhost:5000/ to view

Using a SqlAlchemy Database

Adding a Javascript page
    Added src folder with index.js file
    Added public folder with favicon.ico, index.html, manifest.json
        In index.js set up base template with head imports of
            Symantic UI style sheet, JS, and React
    Added route to main.py for components page
        Is not correct route -- also have to start seperately, so needs more research.
