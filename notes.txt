Create portfolio galleries -- dropdown to go do different specialties
    - should be able to copy the initial page and make adjustments, and then just change the nav

Make docs for this!!!!! This is terrible, I don't even know which fucking flask environment goes 
with this project. 

To Start Flask Env: source activate site-env

Packages: certifi, click, flask, flask-sqlalchemy (forge), itsdangerous, jinja2, markupsafe, 
        pip, pymysql, python, setuptools, sqlalchemy (forge), vc, vs2105_runtime, werkzeug, 
        wheel, wincertstore

To run project:
        - In main folder in terminal:
            - Activate flask env
            - Run: python main.py
            - Open http://localhost:5000/ to view
